Border	Range of k	Coordinates	Formula
Top	0 ≤ k < N	(x = k, y = 0)	—
Right	N ≤ k < 2N-1	(x = N-1, y = k - (N-1))	—
Bottom	2N-1 ≤ k < 3N-2	(x = (N-1) - (k - (2N-2)), y = N-1)	—
Left	3N-2 ≤ k < 4N-4	(x = 0, y = (N-1) - (k - (3N-3)))	—


# First things first

I need to get a board which have the informations needed:
- size of the square board
- number of clues
- possibilities of answer
- possibility number
- the clue for each line
- the starting cell of each clue
- the direction of each clue
- the answers for each line (in this case, number of line = board size * 2)
